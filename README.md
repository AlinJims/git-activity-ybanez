What I Learned About Git & GitHub
Git is an open-source distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code over time and collaborate with others efficiently. GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based hosting service built on top of Git that provides a web interface for repository management and collaboration features. Through this activity, I learned that Git operates locally on my computer, giving me full control over my project's history, while GitHub serves as a remote platform where I can store, share, and manage my repositories online.
